Heart disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality globally: it accounts for more deaths annually than any other cause. According to the WHO, an estimated 17.9 million people died from heart disease in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Over three quarters of these deaths took place in low- and middle-income countries. Of all heart diseases, coronary heart disease (aka heart attack) is by far the most common and the most fatal.<br/>
The silver lining is that heart attacks are highly preventable and simple lifestyle modifications (such as reducing alcohol and tobacco use; eating healthily and exercising) coupled with early treatment greatly improves its prognosis. It is, however, difficult to identify high risk patients because of the multi-factorial nature of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, et cetera. This is where machine learning and data analysis comes to the rescue.
In this document we will be giving a walk through on the development of a classification model for predicting whether a patient has 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) using different Machine Learning techniques on the Framingham dataset .
